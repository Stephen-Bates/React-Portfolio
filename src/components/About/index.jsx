            <p>
                I'm a Fullstack developer who has been studying computers since early highschool.
                In my early years, I would spend my free time indipendantly developing video games.
                As I grew older, I became very interested in manufacturing and spent several years working in factories, learning everything I could about the trade.
                Now, I find myself pulled back to where I always felt most comfortable, in the computer sciences.
                I wonder, what new technologies I'll learn about next?
